# Autocomplete
Autocomplete is a simple experiment in building a autocomplete querying system within the console.

## Process
Before starting the project, I had heard about Tries and wanted to experiment with them. So, this project was created. 

### Iteration 1
The first iteration of the project uses a Trie to store the words and query the stored words that start with a particular prefix.

### Future
- Iteration 2: Radix Tree
- Find other, faster data structures for fetching, even if insertion is slower.
